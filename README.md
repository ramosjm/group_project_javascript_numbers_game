# group_project_javascript_numbers_game


Welcome to the JS Numbers game.

Group Project done in 1 week as part of a group of 3.

The brief was to create a game. We chose a concept of a game where we are able to guess a user's chosen number from a range.

In order to run this you will require npm to install all dependecies.
All dependencies can be found in the package.json.

The game will require you to use 'npm run build' on the console.

You will also be required to use 'npm run server:dev'. this will create a local server on LocalHost:3000.

After this, you will be ready to play the game.
